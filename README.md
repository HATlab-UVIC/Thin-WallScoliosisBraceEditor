# Thin-WallScoliosisBraceEditor

This project is the ongoing development of an augmented reality application for the fitting of scoliosis brace in an effort to streamline the farbication process. 

## Required Materials

The Thin-Wall Scoliosis brace editor requires the following equipment/software for implementation: 
- Microsoft HoloLens 2 with the latest updated version of Windows
- Unity Engine 2022.3.11f1 or later (Vuforia 10.18 requires 2022.3.5 +) - [Linked Here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.11)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 17.5.5 - [Linked here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- Vuforia Engine 10.18 - [Linked here](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk)
- Microsoft Mixed Reality ToolKit (MRKT) 2.8.3 and Open XR 1.9.0

## Getting Started 

In order to use the application, the following steps must be taken: 

1. Clone and open this repository in Unity
2. Import Vuforia Engine
3. Mixed Reality ToolKit using MixedRealityFeature.exe
4. Configure MRTK for HoloLens2
5. More later :)
   
## Future Development

The following features should be added/developed to better enhance the application:
- Microsoft Mesh: Create a shared experience for multiple clinicians to be able to see the scoliosis brace being edited
- Shaders: Doing research into the best shaders to use on the brace to allow clinicians to see everything they need to and creating those shaders for the app
- General stability: With the Vuforia, the app doesn't run as fast as it needs to for clinicians to be able to edit the brace, hopefully with more updates to the HoloLens, Vuforia and Unity the project can run better however finding ways to optimize these settings for the quickest runtime and best performance is necessary. Another image detection software or anchoring method could be researched as well, Vuforia is just very developer friendly and was the only one that worked for me while I tried a few. 
- Accuracy and Usability: Finding ways to optimize the brushes and brush sizes to allow for the most accurate fitting and implementing those features
